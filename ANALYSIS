0. High level
-------------

In the given sample, there are:
- 24622 invites that have been sent to service providers
- 12819 invites got and answer
So the average ratio of answer is about 0.5
There has been 4961 requests
So 5 invites are sent per request on average, and 2 to 3 quotes are received by the user

1. Analysis of quote/requests : answer rate & answer profile
------------------------------------------------------------

There is a large spread from one categories to another for the ratio of quotes invites sent to the quotes sent.
This means that the service providers do not have the same "levels" of professionalism?
Some professions tend to answer more to the customers.

What could explain this ?
Is it because these professions receive to many invites?
-> Look at the total # invites for the professions with lowest ratio
How does it compare to the total # of invite?

-> Is it because of some locations where some service providers are particularly bad?
Let's get the standard deviation of ratio per location for the top bad places

If we look at the standard deviation accross locations for the top 30 categories with the lowest answer ratio rate,
we realize that there it is not very high.
Same for the categories with a high answer ratio rate.
So no matter what the location is, we can fairly say that it really is a property of a category to have a low or high
answer quotes / invite rate.

Time to answer?

2. Analysis of service providers
--------------------------------

Now if service providers are not so profesionnal depending on the categories, lets look deeper into these guys behavior

print inv_bysrvprov.describe() already provide a lot of information

- 75% of the service providers receive less than 32 invites to send a quote
- 75% of the service providers send less than 17 quotes
- The top 25% of service providers are roughly those sending answer to more than 2/3 of their quotes invites
- The mean of inv_id is 24 and the 50% percentile is at 18. So it is a smaller number of service providers who gets the most quotes

If we look at it in more details


3. Analysis of customers behavior
---------------------------------

We fall short on the analysis here...
No customers have more than one request on this dataset.
