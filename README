General approach to the problem:

1. Data Exploration to get a better understanding of the problem

2. Resolving the problem with an MVI : Data Analysis
a) Define in details the operational questions to answer
b) Answer each of these questions

3. Discussion about moving this further into production
a. What are the new data requirements from the analysis
b. Datamart design for an automated analysis
c. Prediction models: Machine Learning applications to this problem
